# Marina_Snow
  * Bayside Marina re-texturing for SA-MP. Good for some server
  * This map will be updated later for any improvements

# Installation
  * Add RemoveBuildingForPlayer (OnPlayerConnect callback) before CreatePlayerObject
  * Add CreatePlayerObject after RemoveBuildingForPlayer (place it under remove building)
  * Compile your gamemode / filterscript
  * Enjoy!

# Note
  * I don't know how to use dynamic object for this map. since these objects will replace thr original one in same position
  * So if you're using dynamic object and removed the building per-player, it will changed into a void instead of snow biome
  * If you have any problem you can ask me on my alt-discord (Samsudin#1956)
